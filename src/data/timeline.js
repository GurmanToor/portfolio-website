      "I had an absolute blast working at Priceline as a co-op software developer on the Flights, Car and Insurance API team! As this was my 2nd work-term, I had a bit more experience in how to approach problems and how to work within my team. My entire team was such a joy to work with and I learned so much about API development from just the 4 months that I was there.",

      "I couldn't have asked for a better first work-term experience with QDoc. I was extremely nervous going into the role, but the guidance and mentorship that I received from the entire team really helped a lot while I was there! Surprisingly, I even managed to work on my very own project that would speed up the process of faxing breast requisitons for hundreds of doctors that used the platform.",

I decided to leave my current planned major of Kinesiology and I decided to start my journey of being a computer science student instead. In my spare time when I wasn't studying kinesiology, I would watch Python tutorials and complete exercises on FreeCodeCamp. I decided it would be better to just fully pursue my hobby of coding!",
